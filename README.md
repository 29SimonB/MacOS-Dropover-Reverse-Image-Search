This project is an "Reverse Image Searcher" to work with the mac app Dropover.

You can import it as "Custom Script". It functions as "Reverse Image Searcher". To do so it takes the file path of the image input file and uploads the file to a website to generate a temporary url. This url is used to search with Google Lens.
